# MSMG-Toolkit Tarball Hashes

SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 hashes from the MSMG Toolkit files (when archived into a tarball using 7-Zip).

## Where can I download MSMG-Toolkit?

The link to the [offical site](https://msmgtoolkit.in/downloads.html).

I also have the files mirrored in my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15BFUmOro8DElSbmy92r6yCaSlte4cuTv/view?usp=sharing), although I would still recommend you to download it from the official source.

## Will I get a virus by using this?

Honestly, I don't know.

I have tried to check some files with Virus Total (ex. [Toolkit_v13.2.zip](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/934feacfaa0af9b17fe4c76953d8a5cafac83d556c5a41323ae3f58f6af9456d/)) and got far too many warnings.

Perhaps it has to do with some of the files that the software uses for all the image modifications, but at the end of the day, I'm not the most knowledgeable to call stuff on that.

I will say, though, that in my research by asking people online and reading forums, it seems to be all a potential false positive.

That being said, I would still recommend running it on a **Virtual Machine** or a **Sandbox** to isolate the software from the main components of your computer. You know, for that extra schizophrenic layer of security :trollface:.

## TODO
- Setup GitHub pages for easier viewing of the tables
- Add fancy stuff to the README.md
- Find a method for easily reproducible tarballs
