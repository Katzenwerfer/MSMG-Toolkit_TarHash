# MSMG-Toolkit Tarball Hashes

SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 hashes from the MSMG Toolkit files (when archived into a tarball)

## Where can I download MSMG-Toolkit?

The link to the [offical site](https://msmgtoolkit.in/downloads.html).

I also have the files mirrored in my [Google Drive]() (link pending), although I would still recommend you to download it from the official source.



## TODO
- Setup GitHub pages for easier viewing of the tables
- Add fancy stuff to the README.md
